## Selecting Parts of a dataframe: subscript

```

it is often useful to select certain rows, based on logical tests on the values of one or more variables.

```{r}
attach(worms)
worms[area > 3 & slope < 3,]
```

## Sorting

By default, things in R are sorted into ascending order.

```{r}
worms[order(area), c(2, 3, 5, 7)]
```
